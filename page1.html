    Sister Orca’s Mystical Journey
    To the <div>far ends of</div> the world that reach beyond the horizons of time…
    Sister Orca and family venture north to seek her native village.
    A village <span>where the mystic wind</span> carries upon her breath the myths of yesterday.
    She gently whispers through the ancient forest of cedar and pine
    and dashes upon the elaborately carved poles…
    Upon the sandy beach, some lay asleep…weathered and decayed
    and covered with mossy blankets of teal green, pale blues and golden browns.
    They too will return home.
    It’s a cool summer evening…
    In my long house, I nestle among my soft woolen blankets, warmed by the fire
    I wait for the bellowing sounds of breaching whales and that of Sister Orca.
    Suddenly a thick, dense fog appears overhead.
    Fog, he laces through our village as if to cover us with a mysterious spell of the
    unknown. It muffles sounds of every kind,
    to silence us from our most inner thoughts of mysteries yet to come.
    Moments later I hear a loud noise which I’ve never heard before…
    Loud sounds of thunder crackling high above the mystic Blue Mountains …
    and rolling through the lush valleys below.
    I’m nearly blinded by the flash of light that penetrates my entry door.
    Dazed and confused I peel off my blankets
    and crawl slowly upon the earthen floor towards the opening of our whale house.
    I peer high above toward the deafening sounds of clapping wings.
    Lightning bolts of cobalt blue lash and pierce through Fog’s thick cape …
    Creating immense transparent holes steaming with fire…
    The sky is painted wildly with brushstrokes of brilliant oranges and crimson reds
    I gaze up …I see Thunderbird
    With accuracy he once again hurdles lighting bolts towards Fog …
    Breaking the spell…the spell is broken.
    I regain consciousness…
    and harmony prevails once again over our village
    As the new dawn arrives
     the sun breaks through the misty morning veil
    it shines brightly…
    I peer towards the ocean with amazement…
    I see Sister Orca gently nudging her son on their Mystical Journey home
    He stays close to her side for comfort and protection…he will someday be Chief.
